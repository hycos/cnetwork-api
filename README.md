# Integration

For the time being, because there are no stable releases yet, there are only
Maven snapshots available that can be easily integrated into your application.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.hycos</groupId>
    <artifactId>cnetwork-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```


# Usage

## Constraint Network Construction

The example below illustrates how to use the cnetwork API. The
`ConstraintNetworkBuilder` manages the constraint network construction. The
`addOperand()`, `addOperation()` and `addConstraint()` methods add
variables/operands, operations (i.e., a function with a non-boolean return
value) and constraints to the network, respectively. All of these methods
create `Node` instances in the constraint network. The `addOperand()` method
takes as argument the type and the identifier as input, whereas the
`addOperation()` and `addConstraint()` methods takes as input the kind of
operation/constraint and the involved parameter nodes.

```java
ConstraintNetworkBuilder cn = new ConstraintNetworkBuilder();
Node zero = cn.addOperand(NodeKind.NUMLIT, "0");
Node one = cn.addOperand(NodeKind.NUMLIT, "1");
Node three = cn.addOperand(NodeKind.NUMLIT, "3");
Node dot = cn.addOperand(NodeKind.STRLIT, ".");
Node add = cn.addOperation(NodeKind.ADD, one, zero);
cn.addConstraint(NodeKind.EQUALS, add, zero);
```

## Slicing 

In case you would like to do an impact analysis in a constraint network, you
can use the `CnetworkSlicerForward` object or `CnetworkSlicerBackward` classes.
The slicer takes as input a constraint network instance. After invoking the
`slice()` method with the slicing criterion as input, the method returns a set
of the nodes which appear in the slice. The following code snippet illustrates
a backward slicing example where the set `nodes` contains the two constraint
network nodes `tostr` and `var`.

```java
Node five = cn.addOperand(NodeKind.NUMLIT, "5");
Node s = cn.addOperand(NodeKind.STRLIT, "s");
Node var = cn.addOperand(NodeKind.NUMVAR, "v");
Node tostr = cn.addOperation(NodeKind.TOSTR, var);

Node concat = cn.addOperation(NodeKind.CONCAT, tostr, s);

CnetworkSlicerBackward b = new CnetworkSlicerBackward(cn
        .getConstraintNetwork());
```

## Visualization

You can visualize a constraint network by invoking the `.toDot()` method which
serializes the constraint network in the `.dot` output format. From this input
format, you print a graph by means of [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) (for
example by invoking `dot -T pdf <infile> -o <ofile>`). In case you would like
to automate this task, this
[script](https://gist.github.com/julianthome/66a31203b9b25493fa2a43889f948212)
might be useful. 

```java

ConstraintNetworkBuilder cb = new ConstraintNetworkBuilder();
// ...
System.out.println(cb.getConstraintNetwork().toDot());
```


The constraint network for the first example would look as
follows.
